# Cordium

Cordium is a GTK and Rust based messaging app, inspired by Franz/Ferdi. I however prefer a config file based solution and I needed a hobby project to learn both GTK and Rust. This means that the code in this project probably will be sub-optimal.

## Name

Cordium derives its name from the Latin words compendium, which means 'complete collection of knowledge' and orda, Latin for 'ordened'.

There will be five people who will get this inside joke, and at most four who will think it's funny.
