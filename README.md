# Cordium

Cordium is a GTK and Rust based messaging app, inspired by Franz/Ferdi. I however prefer a config file based solution and I needed a hobby project for both GTK and Rust development.

## Name

Cordium derives its name from the Latin words compendium, which means 'complete collection of knowledge' and orda, Latin for 'ordened'.
